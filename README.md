# protex
ProTeX is a Python tool that processes documentation comments embedded in source files (e.g., Fortran code) and generates a formatted LaTeX document. By using a standardized set of markers, ProTeX allows you to maintain your documentation alongside your source code and automatically produce high-quality documentation.
